pseudocode for 2D halfwidth LOS algorithm

1. determine whether obstacle is left or right of [1,0,0] in camera reference frame.
    (use S2,L1 or S3,L1, or just S2 or S3) to provide range for stereographic projection.

2. multiply pixel2los() unit vector by sensor range. take rLOSy component

3. compare to half width of platform.
    if (rLOSy + obstacle_halfwidth) > platform_halfwidth, obstacle is not in the forward safe path

4. guess that the halfwidth of a person is 200mm.
    guess that the halfwidth of a car is 1000mm

5.
