This repository contains all necessary software to compile a complete FORWARD build. This code models and manages all peripherals for FORWARD.

The modeled peripherals are:
  - Sonar Sensors
  - Haptic Motors
  - Wheel Brush Motors
  - Potentiometer
  - IMU

The code also contains all needed models and algorithms for:
  - FORWARD enviroment
  - Utilities
