This repository contains all necessary software to compile a complete FORWARD build. This code models and manages all peripherals for FORWARD.

The modeled peripherals are:
- Sonar Sensors  
- Haptic Motors  
- Wheel Brush Motors  
- Potentiometer  
- IMU  

The code also contains all needed models and algorithms for:
- FORWARD environment  
- Utilities  
- Networking  

This code base implements many principles of object-oriented programming.
